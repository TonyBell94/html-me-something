<h2>How does one write about nothing?</h2>
<p class="center">You start by stringing a bunch of letters and words together<br>
without the structure of grammer we will see how far into the<br>
world of nothing we get but that wont work because nothing is<br>
impossible to create or is it? I think there is a website that<br>
 will generate a bunch of random text for you but i dont recall<br>
  what it is called :( so i am going to keep writing giberish<br>
how do you spell? who knows... I this is the worst part about<br>
this assignment.</p>
